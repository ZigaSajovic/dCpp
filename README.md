#Operational calculus and algebra of Algorithms

###Abstract

In this paper, we develop the theory of analytic programming languages, that implement infinitely-differentiable programming spaces, and operators acting upon them.

A programming space is defined as an algebra monoid in a function vector space of mappings on the virtual memory. Virtual memory is constructed through tensor algebra and endowed with its' own algebra of algorithms. Using this algebra, we construct differential operators, that span the space of infinitely-differentiable programs. We present a wholesome theory of operators, that enables analysis of programs and computations on the operator level, which favors general implementation. Through the theory, we derive new operators, that expand a program into an infinite tensor series in the algebra of algorithms. The theory is used to analyze iterators and other control structures in programming languages, and their dependencies on boundary conditions. The developed facilitates functional transformations of programs in an arbitrary function basis. Through it, the theory grants us the ability to choose programs' complexity, while knowing the order of the error of the approximation.

Thus the theory opens new doors in program analysis. We show the existence of a procedure testing an object for a property to be sufficient for constructing a procedure enforcing that property upon it.
